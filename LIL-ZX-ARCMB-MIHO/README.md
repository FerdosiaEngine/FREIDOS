# LIL-ZX-ARCMB-MIHO

LIL-ZX-ARCMB-MIHO, is a very powerful text encryption program written in Python 3 and developed by Klaus Bluseng.

## Project content

The project file consists of two small files needed to run the code sequence for encryption. For optimal operation and return of the correct result, these tabs cannot be modified.

## Way of usage

The dependence of the current program is represented by the existence of the Python 3 programming language.

You also need to add the Python path to the Windows Path variable (which will be searched for executables when you type a command at the command prompt), if it doesn't already exist.

After downloading the encryption files you are almost ready to run the code. All you have to do is open the command prompt, where you will enter the whole path to the folder where the execution files are, in the form:

```
cd C:\...\LIL-ZX-ARCMB-MIHO
```

For setting the path, the commands to execute the code will be used as follows (the first for encryption, the second for decryption):

```
python make.py
```

```
python remake.py
```

## Quick start in entering the text for encryption

After entering the text for encryption, the program will display the desired result (as well as the pre-used encryption method). For decryption, the final result of the previous encryption will be used. Unaccepted characters will remain unchanged after running the program.

In order to display the correct result, in the case of encryption, the initially entered text must exist and be written without diacritics or numbers.

```
Example of encryption: n;d= B2+2 XAT9 jWAY 032+ CI=* 8(
```
